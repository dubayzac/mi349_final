                    While working on FitKeeper, I focused on the layout and design elements seen on each screen. During this project, 
                    I learned the process of user interface design and what it entails. I enjoyed toying around which individual elements to 
                    find my desired aesthetic. FitKeeper was created using proto.io. </p>

                <p id="description2">Bam's Boothies is a business proposal for a subscription-based service. This business would offer 
                    healthy and pre-packaged smoothie ingredients, delivered to your doorstep. Food delivery services are growing rapidly, 
                    meaning it would be a great time to tap into that market. While working on the proposal, I created accounts on Facebook 
                    and Twitter to publicize the idea behind the company. This included posting various advertisements as well as posts to  
                    encourage engagement.</p>

                <p id="description3">Throughout my experience with programming languages, one I found to be unique was JavaScript. 
                    Personally, this was the first language I ever experienced in the world of code. Once I learned the basics, I decided 
                    to replicate the famous arcade game, Breakout. I enjoyed this project because I learned how to create and alter on-screen 
                    elements using JavaScript. I programmed my version of Breakout inside of the CodeHS IDE.</p>
